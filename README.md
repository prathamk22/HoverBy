# Hover-By
This is Pratham Khurana here with a new Android Application Concept.

Android Application name: <b>Hover By</b>

Minimum Android Version:<b>19(Kitkat)</b>

Material User Interface

Realtime Firebase Database

Not Even a single user data is uploaded to server. Everything is handled using Shared Preference only.

### Concept

If a person wants to know if a shop, shopping complex, PVR, movie theatre 
have some certain items or any public related query and somehow not able to contect them personally. At that scenario <b>Hover by</b> comes,
here people can ask a question and another person who is near that place and knows how to solve the query can write his views or suggestions
on this app. This reduces people efforts of calling or going to that particular place to have their queries solved.
